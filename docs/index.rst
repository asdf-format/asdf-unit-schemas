Included Resources
==================

The following are listings of all the schemas provided by this package for ASDF.

.. note::
  Typically, schemas are used in ASDF via their tag, which can be found in the manifest.
  Use of the tag is recommended (instead of directly referencing the schema) to allow
  ASDF to look up the correct schema version corresponding to the tag depending on
  the manifest in use.
